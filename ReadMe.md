# Kotlin Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of key data structures and algorithms implemented using Modern Kotlin and its best practices. The goal is to build these implementations from the ground up, fostering a deep understanding of their inner workings.

---

## Overview

Leveraging the latest features of Kotlin, this project offers custom implementations of essential data structures and algorithms. The code is organized into modular packages, ensuring clarity, ease of maintenance, and an excellent resource for learning.

---

## Folder Structure

- **src/main/kotlin**  
  Contains the primary source code. Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in its respective package, following a clean and modular structure.

- **src/test/kotlin**  
  Houses unit tests that verify the correctness and robustness of the implementations.
